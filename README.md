# Challenge-1-Code-Refactor for Horiseon Social Solutions, Inc.
Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to refactor the code of an existing marketing agency site to make it more accessible, while adhering to the Scout Ruleâ€”always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it. The other main objective of the challenge was to increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and include comments before each element or section of the page.
